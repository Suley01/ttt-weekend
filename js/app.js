/*-------------------------------- Functions --------------------------------*/
init () 
//calling init function when app loads
//create init function to initialize game state
function init(){
  board = [null, null, null, null, ,null, null, null, null, null]
  //null meaning it is empty or unknown
  turn = 1
  //1 represents player X
  winner = null 
  render()
  //call function render

}



// Step 4 - The state of the game should be rendered to the user

 // // 4a) Create a function called `render`.
function render(){
  board.forEach(function(square, i){
    if (board[i] === 1){
      squareEls[i].textContent = 'X'
    }
    
  })
}

  // 4b) Loop over `board` and for each element:
  //     - Use the current index of the iteration to access the corresponding square in the `squareEls` array.
  //     - Style that square however you wish, dependent on the value  
  //       contained in the current cell being iterated over (`-1`, `1`, or
  //       `null`).  
  
  // 4c) Render a message based on the current game state:
  //     - If winner has a value of `null` (meaning the game is still in
  //       progress), render whose turn it is.
  //     - If `winner` is equal to `'T'` (tie), render a tie message.
  //     - Otherwise, render a congratulatory message to the player that has 
  //       won.
    

// Step 5 - Define the required constants

  // 5a) In a constant called `winningCombos` define the eight possible winning 
  //     combinations as an array of arrays.

// Step 6 - Handle a player clicking a square with a `handleClick` function

  // 6a) Create a function called `handleClick`. It will have an `evt`
  //     parameter.

  // 6b) Attach an event listener to the game board (you can do this to each
  //     one of the existing `squareEls` OR add a new cached element reference
  //     that will allow you to take advantage of event bubbling). On the
  //     `'click'` event, it should call the `handleClick` function
  //     you created in 6a.

  // 6c) Obtain the index of the square that was clicked by "extracting" the 
  //     index from an `id` assigned to the element in the HTML. Assign this  
  //     to a constant called `sqIdx`.

  // 6d) If the `board` has a value at the `sqIdx`, immediately `return`  
  //     because that square is already taken. Also, if `winner` is not `null`
  //     immediately `return` because the game is over.

  // 6e) Update the `board` array at the `sqIdx` with the current value of
  //     `turn`.

  // 6f) Change the turn by multiplying `turn` by `-1` (this flips a `1` to
  //     `-1`, and vice-versa).

  // 6g) Set the `winner` variable if there's a winner by calling a new 
  //     function: `getWinner`.

  // 6h) All the state has been updated so we need to render our updated state 
  //     to the user by calling the `render` function we wrote earlier.

// Step 7 - Build the `getWinner` function

  // 7a) Create a function called `getWinner`

  /* 
   * There are two methods you can use to find out if there is a winner.
   *
   * Step b1 below is a more elegant method that takes advantage of the
   * `winningCombos` array you wrote above in step 5. 
   *
   * Step b2 might be a little simpler to comprehend, but you'll need to write  
   * more code. Step b2 also won't take advantage of the `winningCombos`
   * array, but using it as a reference will help you build a solution.
   * ***Ensure you choose only one path.***
   */

  // 7b1)Loop through each of the winning combination arrays defined in the 
  //     `winningCombos` array. Total up the three board positions using the 
  //     three indexes in the current combo. Convert the total to an absolute 
  //     value (convert any negative total to positive). If the total equals 3, 
  //     we have a winner! Set the `winner` variable to the board's value at
  //     the index specified by the first index of that winning combination's
  //     array by returning that value.

  // 7b2)For each one of the winning combinations you wrote in step 5, find the
  //     total of each winning combination. Convert the total to an absolute 
  //     value (convert any negative total to positive). If the total equals 3, 
  //     we have a winner! Set the `winner` variable to the board's value at 
  //     the index specified by the first index of that winning combination's 
  //     array by returning that value.

// 7c) If there is no winner, check to see if there is a tie. Set the  
  //     `winner` variable to `'T'` if there are no more nulls in the board  
  //     array byreturning the string `'T'`.

  // 7d) If there is no winner and there isn’t a tie, return `null`.

// Step 8 - Create Reset functionality

  // 8a) Add a reset button to the HTML document.

  // 8b) Store the new reset button element in a constant named `resetBtnEl`.

  // 8c) Attach an event listener to the `resetBtnEl`. On the `'click'` event 
  //     it should call the `init` function you created in 3.
